The 2009 CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Programming Errors is a list of the most significant programming errors that can
lead to serious software vulnerabilities. They occur frequently, are often easy to find, and easy to exploit. They are
dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the 
software from working at all.
 
I’ve been going through these today for an internal security review - it’s a very good read with lots of helpful 
analogies. <http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/>
