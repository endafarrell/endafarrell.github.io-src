From listening to [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/) for the first time today I should play with 
[Yahoo’s YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/). It’s a server developer tool 
that allows you to query the web in a SQL-like format - and have the results come back in JSON. Where it gets really 
cool is when you mash-up different sites - then things become really useful.
