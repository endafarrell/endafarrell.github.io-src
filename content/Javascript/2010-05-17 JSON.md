I keep loosing these links, so I thought Iâ€™d spend a minute and gather them here:

* [http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/]() - really excellent
* [http://chris.photobooks.com/json/default.htm]()
* [http://www.thomasfrank.se/downloadableJS/JSONeditor_example.html]()

These sites all do something a wee bit different from each other, and at different times I have used them all.

Update 2016-06-25 12:00: Over the last 6 years a different site has become my go-to for getting a better look at my
content:

* [http://jsbeautifier.org]()

I'd be surprised if this site is news to anyone, but just in case ;-)
