&lt;p&gt;Below is a graph of how things are currently. As I am changing things you can deduce that the regime is not correct, 
but it isn’t too far off (I think). The four different lines are (from the bottom)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thick blue columns are the hourly dose in 100iU units (scale on the left in U/hr). The early morning spike is an 
  attempt to handle my “dawn phenomenon” but it’s not quite working as I’d like. The afternoon dip was a reflection of 
  many lows which I had had in the autumn of 2010. In total I take 18.59U basal daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thin blue line is the average basal of 0.77 hourly (scale on the left in U/hr).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The green line is my Carb Ratio in units per 10g (scale on the left in U/10g). A ratio that varies from 1.0 to 1.2 
  back to 1.1 is quite low - most of these ratios go from 1.0 to 2.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The red line is drawn with the scale on the right - my sensitivity in mmol/L for 1 U of insulin. These sensitivity 
  are very high - they are normally 2 to 3 - so the 3 to 4 as I have here are unusual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="insulin" src="http://endafarrell.net/images/Insulin-regime.1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My HbA1C as of 5 Jan 2011 is 7.3 which suggests that the overall insulin dose is quite close to being correct (as a 
value of 7.0 is quite good, with 6.5 being really very good) - but - there are often quite a lot of corrective doses 
of extra insulin. This mean that either more basal is needed or there is a problem with my ratios and/or carb 
estimation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first set of changes relate to some morning readings - as shown here. Though only 3 days readings are shown, this 
pattern has I believe been going on for about 6 weeks. I have anecdotal evidence of post breakfast lows after giving 
corrective doses first thing - but foolishly I hadn’t been taking more glucose readings at breakfast. I had been 
assuming that the correction was still making its way through the system and so didn’t retest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="insulin" src="http://endafarrell.net/images/Insulin-regime.2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart says a few things to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need more basal on the run up to 6:00/6:30 in the morning. These elevated readings of 12 or 13 are not the result 
of a pre-dawn hypo rebound - there is no way the readings could drop so quickly afterwards.
Either my sensitivity in the morning is off the scale at 6 mmol/L per 1U or I have too much basal between 6:30 and 
7:30 (I never eat at 06:30, my first food of the day is at 07:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of the 8th I tried “playing” with these and instead of giving the normal corrective dose I gave only 
half and this explains why the drop in glucose levels took twice as long as before. Neither of the likely explanations 
(that I have too much basal or an off-the-chart sensitivity) are what I would call “attractive” but I think it makes 
more sense to deal with the too-much-basal - which when combined with knowing that I do need more basal in the hours 
up to 6 am - can be as simple as to move the dawn phenomenon basal spike earlier in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving it by two hours seems too much (though I can’t support this statement - it’s just a gut feeling) so I’ll start 
by moving it by one to see the effect. I’ll report on that in a week or so. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="basal-bolus"></category><category term="insulin"></category><category term="pump"></category><category term="diabetes"></category></entry><entry><title>Uncertain overnight behaviour</title><link href="http://endafarrell.net/uncertain-overnight-behaviour.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-27T20:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-10-27T20:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Enda Farrell</name></author><id>tag:endafarrell.net,2009-10-27:/uncertain-overnight-behaviour.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's getting to be a wonder what's happening overnight.

&lt;li&gt;23rd: 14.9@4:51: recovery from a 2.3 at 20:54 the previous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that the jury is out on whether or not the overnights are working: Is there still too much insulin 
being pushed through in the dead of night? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem that having stable bedtime readings is even more important as the proportion of background insulin is 
smaller now than ever before at night. It also seems that even a small amount of alcohol has a significant effect.
Next up is to get the graphing software from Roche running at home - that may make some things a little easier to spot. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="diabetes"></category><category term="medicine"></category><category term="insulin"></category></entry><entry><title>Accu-Chek Combo</title><link href="http://endafarrell.net/accu-chek-combo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-18T20:20:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-10-18T20:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Enda Farrell</name></author><id>tag:endafarrell.net,2009-10-18:/accu-chek-combo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Accu-Chek Combo is an insulin pump that has the potential to make really important changes to how I manage my

needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do the downsides first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a machine that I have to wear - always&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of "fiddley" components and parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring it to me is going to take a lot of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are going to be some upsides too of course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can up the background rates by adjusting the insulin rate on an hour-by-hour basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The combined meter/advisor is a major improvement over previous devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can record and analyse things like basal rates, insulin sensitivity, onset and durations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got it last Friday (2009-10-16), and on that morning we'd (there were 4 of us receiving their Combos) helped each 
other programme our units. I was going to be on a 0.68 U/hr flat profile - though by the end of the day I'd made a 
small change to start counter-acting the severe case of dawn phenomenon that I suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there were a few details that happened on that first day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went low by 4am (3.9) - therefore I want to have 1 U less between midnight and 4 am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, +0.2 is not enough to deal with the Dawn Phenomenon =&amp;gt; up from 4 to 6 am by another +1U&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then smoothened out a little, I got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="initial setup" src="http://endafarrell.net/images/Accu-Chek-Combo.1.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="dawn phenomenon" src="http://endafarrell.net/images/Accu-Chek-Combo.2.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="another take on the dawn phenomenon" src="http://endafarrell.net/images/Accu-Chek-Combo.3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart shows a marked reduction between midnight (on the left) and three am, and a major increase between 3 and 6 
am - to start countering the dawn phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside - that low-to-high swing from midnight to 6 am is simply not doable with insulin which is injected in the 
more "normal" or usual fashion. Different profiles are indeed possible, and for most diabetics they do cover their 
needs -but I don't fit into that category. This is why the Combo pump is so important for my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - how did this work out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well - no hypo overnight so the first part was good. As it happened, my bedtime glucose was only 4.9 (below the DAFNE 
recommended 6.5 so I took an additional 10g carbs - so noy hypo-ing in that circumstance was really quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the second part was at least a partial success. For the first time in 6 months I had a proper lie-in - I didn't 
waken 'til 10 - which for me would have GUARANTEED me a glucose level of 17 or more - but this morning it was only 
11.0. OK - so not perfect, and as the 1.8U given then wasn't enough to stop my glucose from rising to 12.2 by 11:37 
I can see that I still need another 2U to be delivered before 9 (as it seems my sensitivity is at 3mmol/l per 1U) - 
but perhaps I'll take it a little more slowly than that at first!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="diabetes"></category><category term="medicine"></category><category term="insulin"></category><category term="pump"></category></entry></feed>
